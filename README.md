Bank fraud is increasingly occurring through phishing, identity theft, and sophisticated cyberattacks, exploiting vulnerabilities in digital banking systems.

Analyzed transactional data to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, enhancing the accuracy of fraud detection models.
Utilized SQL queries to extract and visualize high-risk transactions, supporting data-driven decision-making in fraud prevention.

About Dataset
Context

There is a lack of publicly available datasets on financial services especially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.

We present a synthetic dataset generated using the PaySim simulator as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behavior to evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods later.
